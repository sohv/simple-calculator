Just a simple calculator I built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript just to get started with full stack web development.
The calculator has a black and white theme with an user friendly interface (pretty good for a beginner).

If you want to give it a try, go ahead and use it (no assurance that you will absolutely love it though).
